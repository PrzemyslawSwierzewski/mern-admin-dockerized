# Dockerized Web App Learning Project

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is a fork of a random website found on the internet. It is used purely for learning purposes to practice Dockerizing a multi-service web application.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **multi-container web application** using:

- **Frontend:** React (Create React App)  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB  

The goal of this project is **not to produce a full-featured product**, but to explore Docker concepts such as:

- Multi-stage builds for React frontend  
- Environment variable management (`.env` files and Docker build args)  
- Docker Compose orchestration of multiple services  
- Container networking and service-to-service communication  
- Persisting database data using Docker volumes
